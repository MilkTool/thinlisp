1.0

The first line of this file should contain the version number for ThinLisp.
This is used when creating the names for distribution tarballs and zip files.
This version number must also be updated within docs/tl-manual.texinfo and
within the function LISP-IMPLEMENTATION-VERSION in tl/lisp/tl-basics.lisp.

To issue a new release, update the version numbers as described above, tag the
sources with the new version using a tag of the following form.

  TL-<version-using-only-hyphens>-BASE

The base tag is made so that a branch can be made off of this tag later if there
is a need to issue a patch to this release.  From within the src directory of a
checked out source repository, run the following command to create a new
exported src directory.

  cvs export -r TL-<version>-BASE src

Then run a "make distribution" to make a new directory called "dist" within the
sandbox src directory.  The dist directory will contain the files for a new
distribution of a ThinLisp release.
