Missing ANSI CL features and other stuff that needs doing:

- If it's in the spec but not in tlt/lisp/exports.lisp, then it's not
implemented.

- CLOS is missing (multimethods sorely needed).

- format should take more clauses

- A way should be provided through 'defsystem' to add options to the
auto-generated makefiles.

- Arrays need a lot of work. Currently there are no displaced,
adjustable or multidimensional arrays. Also, fill-pointers only work
for certain array types.

- It would probably be a good idea to provide the Boehm-Demers-Weiser
conservative garbage collector as an option.
