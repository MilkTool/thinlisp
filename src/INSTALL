ThinLisp is shipped as a gzipped tarball and as a zip file.

1.  Unpack the distribution into a directory of your choice.  To
unpack the tarball on UNIX or Windows where Cygwin has been installed,
use the following commands.

  cd <install-directory>
  tar xzvf thinlisp-1.1.tgz

To unpack the zip file, use Winzip or some equivalent on Windows, or
use the following command.

  cd <install-directory>
  unzip thinlisp-1.1.tgz

2. Change *thinlisp-source-path* in boot.lisp appropriately.

3. Start your CL, and load boot.lisp. This translates ThinLisp and the
lecho example program.

4. Build the ThinLisp C libraries. Go to tl/bin, and type make -f
makefile-<system>, where <system> is the one which you think is the
best match for your system.

5. Check out the example programs, lecho and gl-test-box (which
requires GLUT and OpenGL libraries). lecho has already been translated
(in the boot.lisp file), so all you need to do is go to lecho/bin, and
follow the same procedure as step 4. The README file in gl-test-box/
contains the necessary build instructions.

Note that there are top level makefiles and boot.lisp files that
perform many of the tasks described here.  Add lines for your own
subsystems to these in order to get a fully automated build of your
Lisp-based libraries and executables.

Enjoy.
