Thinlisp bugs I've (VS) found (in no particular order):

- There are no nil blocks around defun and other forms that should
have them.

- 'block' seems to be broken (or maybe it's 'return'?)

- The package-related function 'export' is broken

- 'defstruct' inheritance seems to be there, but is actually horribly
broken (not that it would be too useful without multimethods).

- Lambda is not wrapped in an implicit (function)

- Importing header files through 'defsystem' causes builds to fail (it
also puts the includes in the wrong place, but I don't see why it
should break there).

- 'def-tl-foreign-function' and 'def-c' cause bogus header
declarations.

- There is currently no way to declare and pass a callback function in
the lisp code (you have to put in the function name by hand in the C
file).

- Objects of type Obj are not unboxed/coerced before being passed to
foreign functions.

- Array typing is funny (for example, fill-pointers are only
implemented for a few special array types).
